    "Q.3. which python statement  are used to catch and handle \n",
    "exception? explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "solution:\n",
    "In Python, you can use try, except, finally, and optionally,\n",
    "else statements to catch and handle exceptions. Exception handling\n",
    "is a way to gracefully deal with errors and prevent your program \n",
    "from crashing when unexpected issues arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of these statements along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. try block: This is where you place the code that might raise \n",
    "an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. except block: This block is executed when an exception is \n",
    "raised in the corresponding try block. You can specify the type \n",
    "of exception you want to catch, or you can use a generic except \n",
    "block to catch any exception. Multiple except blocks can be used \n",
    "to catch different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. else block (optional): This block is executed if no exceptions\n",
    "are raised in the try block. It's useful for handling code that \n",
    "should run only if the try block executes successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. finally block (optional): This block is executed whether an \n",
    "exception is raised or not. It's often used for cleanup\n",
    "operations, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate how these statements work\n",
    "together:\n",
